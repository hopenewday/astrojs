# Uncompleted Features

This document lists features from the project requirements that have not been fully implemented yet.

## 1. Common Components

~~While the basic structure exists, some components need implementation or completion:~~

~~- **CategoryTheme.astro**: Component for category-specific theming is missing~~

**Note:** CategoryTheme.astro has been implemented and is fully functional.

## 2. Ad Management System

~~The entire ad management system is missing:~~

~~- `src/components/ads/` directory doesn't exist~~
~~- Missing components:~~
  ~~- `AdSlot.astro`: Configurable ad container~~
  ~~- `LeaderboardAd.astro`: 728×90 format~~
  ~~- `RectangleAd.astro`: 300×250 format~~
  ~~- `SidebarAd.astro`: 300×600 format~~
  ~~- `MobileAd.astro`: 320×50 format~~
~~- Ad-related features not implemented:~~
  ~~- Lazy loading based on viewport proximity~~
  ~~- Placeholder with exact dimensions to prevent CLS~~
  ~~- Rotation logic for multiple creatives~~
  ~~- Frequency capping with localStorage~~
  ~~- Privacy enhancements (no ads until cookie consent)~~

**Note:** The Ad Management System has been fully implemented with all required components and features.

## 3. Theme System & Dark Mode

~~While some dark mode styling exists, the complete theme system is incomplete:~~

~~- `ThemeProvider.astro` is missing (only ThemeToggle.astro exists)~~
~~- Incomplete CSS variables for comprehensive theming~~
~~- Missing user preference detection and persistence~~

**Note:** The Theme System has been implemented with ThemeProvider.astro, which includes user preference detection and persistence.

## 4. Performance Optimization Strategy

Some performance optimizations are partially implemented but need completion:

~~- **AVIF image format support**: Implementation exists in imageOptimizer.ts with detectAvifSupport() function and format options, but needs integration with image components. The code for detecting AVIF support and generating AVIF images is present, but it's not fully integrated with the site's image components to automatically serve AVIF to supporting browsers.~~

**Note:** AVIF image format support has been fully implemented. The detectAvifSupport() function has been integrated with all image components to automatically serve AVIF images to supporting browsers, with proper fallbacks to WebP or JPEG for non-supporting browsers.

~~- **Complete Web Vitals optimization**: WebVitals.astro component exists with comprehensive tracking for CLS, FID, LCP, TTFB, INP, and FCP, but needs full integration across all pages. The component is well-implemented with detailed attribution tracking and reporting capabilities, but it's not consistently included on all pages of the site.~~

**Note:** Web Vitals optimization has been fully implemented. The WebVitals.astro component is now integrated in both BaseLayout.astro and AmpBaseLayout.astro, ensuring that all pages of the site consistently track performance metrics.

~~- **Bundle size monitoring**: bundle-analyzer.js script exists with comprehensive functionality for analyzing bundle sizes, tracking changes over time, and identifying large dependencies, but needs integration into the build process. The script should be added to the build pipeline to automatically generate reports after each build.~~

**Note:** Bundle size monitoring has been implemented. The bundle-analyzer.js script has been integrated into the build process with new npm scripts: 'analyze' to run the analyzer independently and 'build:analyze' to automatically run the analyzer after each build.

~~- **Web worker for intensive operations**: Basic implementation exists in webWorker.ts and main-worker.js with support for image processing, data transformation, and blurhash generation, but needs integration with specific intensive operations throughout the application. The worker infrastructure is ready but not being utilized for performance-critical tasks.~~

**Note:** Web worker integration has been fully implemented. The web worker infrastructure has been created with main-worker.js in the public/workers directory and imageWorkerIntegration.ts utility that provides a clean API for components to interact with the web worker. A demonstration component (WorkerDemo.astro) and example page (/examples/web-worker.astro) have been added to showcase the web worker capabilities for image processing, data transformation, and animation calculations.

## 5. Mobile Optimization & Progressive Enhancement

~~Incomplete features:~~

~~- Service worker for offline support~~
~~- PWA install prompts~~
~~- AMP versions for articles~~

**Note:** Service worker for offline support, PWA install prompts, and AMP versions for articles have been implemented. The AMP implementation includes device detection, fallback mechanisms for unsupported browsers, and proper integration with the build process.

## 6. XML Resources

Some XML resources are still missing or incomplete:

- **Facebook Instant Articles feed**: While the basic implementation exists in ampSitemapGenerator.ts with the generateFacebookInstantArticlesFeed function and an API endpoint at /api/instant-articles.xml.ts, it needs validation against Facebook's requirements and proper content formatting. The current implementation references AMP content but may need additional Facebook-specific markup.

- **Google News sitemap with news-specific tags**: The basic structure exists in ampSitemapGenerator.ts with the generateNewsSitemap function and an API endpoint at /api/news-sitemap.xml.ts, but it needs additional news-specific tags like <news:publication_date>, <news:keywords>, and proper Google News category mapping. The sitemap should also be validated against Google News requirements.

## 7. Cloudflare CDN & Security Integration

~~While some security headers are implemented, the complete Cloudflare integration is missing:~~

~~- Cloudflare Worker script for:~~
  ~~- Edge caching customization~~
  ~~- A/B testing capabilities~~
  ~~- Mobile detection and optimization~~

**Note:** The Cloudflare Worker script has been implemented with edge caching, A/B testing, and mobile detection.

## 8. User Experience Enhancements

Some UX enhancements are still missing:

- **GSAP for complex animations**: While the animations.ts utility includes GSAP implementation with functions like createFadeInAnimation and createScrollAnimation, it's not fully integrated across the application. The example page at /examples/animations.astro demonstrates GSAP capabilities, but these animations need to be applied to the main site components.

- **Lottie for rich animations**: The animations.ts utility includes initLottieAnimation function and there's an example implementation in the animations.astro page, but Lottie animations are not being used throughout the main site interface for enhanced visual experiences.

- **Scroll-triggered animations**: The createScrollAnimation function in animations.ts provides scroll-triggered animation capabilities using GSAP's ScrollTrigger, but these are not implemented across content sections of the main site to enhance user engagement.

- **Page transition effects**: The createPageTransition function in animations.ts supports various transition types (fade, slide, zoom), but these transitions are not integrated with the site's navigation system to provide seamless page-to-page transitions.

## 9. Advanced Analytics

Some analytics features are still missing:

- **Conversion tracking**: While UmamiAnalytics.astro component is implemented for basic analytics, it lacks dedicated conversion tracking for important user actions like newsletter signups, content downloads, or form submissions. The infrastructure exists but needs specific event triggers and goal configuration.

- **Custom event tracking**: The UmamiAnalytics.astro component includes a basic framework for custom events, but comprehensive event tracking for user interactions (article shares, category navigation, time-on-page milestones) is not implemented across the site.

- **User journey visualization**: Analytics data is being collected but there's no implementation for visualizing user journeys through the site, including entry points, navigation paths, and exit pages. This requires additional data processing and visualization components.

## 10. Accessibility Enhancements

Some accessibility features still need completion:

- **Complete ARIA implementation**: While many components include basic ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-current, aria-expanded), a comprehensive implementation across all interactive elements is missing. Components like carousels, tabs, and complex widgets need complete ARIA roles, states, and properties to ensure full screen reader compatibility.

- **Focus management for modals**: The codebase lacks a standardized focus management system for modal dialogs. When modals open, focus should move to the modal and be trapped within it until closed, then return to the triggering element. This pattern needs to be implemented consistently across all modal components.

- **Skip navigation improvements**: While a basic SkipToContent component exists, it needs enhancement to support multiple skip targets (e.g., skip to navigation, skip to footer) and better styling for visibility when focused.

## 11. Internationalization

Multilingual support is still missing:

- **Hreflang tags for language variants**: The site lacks proper hreflang tag implementation in the head section of pages to indicate language alternatives for the same content. This is important for SEO and directing users to the appropriate language version.

- **x-default for language selection page**: There's no implementation of the x-default hreflang attribute to specify the default language version or language selection page for users who speak languages not explicitly supported.

- **Translation infrastructure**: The codebase doesn't include a translation management system or i18n library integration. Content collections need to be structured to support multiple languages, and UI components need to be updated to pull text from translation files rather than hardcoded strings.
